ChimpBot
---------
Android API wrapper for the [MailChimp API](http://mailchimp.com/api) API.


###Install & Setup
    
Get your API key from the [Mail Chimp Account page](http://admin.mailchimp.com/account/api/).

**Adding ChimpBot to a project**

Download or build the jar file from the project ([current download here](http://github.com/downloads/mailchimp/ChimpBot/mailchimp.jar)) and include it in the project you'd like to include MailChimp functionality for.  See the MailChimp-SignupForm project for a complete example.

**Building / Running the Projects**

There are Eclipse project files included in each project directory.  To build these projects, you will need to

*  Setup your Android development environment - see the [Android Developer Documentation]](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html) for details on that.
*  Fix the build path in the project to point to your installation/configuration of the Android development SDK.  Do this by going to project --> properties --> Java Build Path --> Libraries and selecting the Android classpath container and adjusting it to point to your library.
